These Assignments and Project aims to provide additional support and guidance to learners enrolled in the SQL for Data Science in a program developed by Univeristy of California, Davis, and Coursera. It recognizes the importance of hands-on practice and real-world application of SQL coding skills in the field of data science.

Through these Assignments and Project, you are presented with a series of challenging SQL coding assignments that complement the coursework provided in the program. These assignments are designed to test and reinforce their understanding of SQL concepts, as well as enhance their problem-solving abilities in a data-driven context.

The Assignmnents and Project offers a structured environment where one can apply their SQL knowledge to practical scenarios, such as querying databases, manipulating data, and performing complex analytics tasks. It provides a platform for learners to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding of SQL and its applications in data science.

I am privilaged to take part in these Assignment and project. Check out my work on the files posted above.
